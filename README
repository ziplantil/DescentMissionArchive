DXMA (Descent Mission Archive; X standing in for 1, 2, 3, etc.) is a PHP web application that
provides an interface for uploading and searching mission files for Descent games (as well as Overload).

The program requires at least PHP 7.4 as well as MySQL (with InnoDB or
a compatible storage engine), or MariaDB.
When installed, the application should be configured by modifying config.php (under config) under
the config folder. You may also want to look at about.php (under config) and replace its content
with whatever you want, and add a noimg.png under the dxma folder as a placeholder for missions
without a screenshot.

The MySQLi PHP extension must also be available.

The code is not the best or cleanest I have written, but it does the job. It follows a
quasi-MVC structure and uses PHP itself as a templating engine.
